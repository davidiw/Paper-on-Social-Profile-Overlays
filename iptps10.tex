\subsection*{Abstract}
% Use Online Social Networks instead of social networks
Online social networking has quickly become one of the most common activities of Internet users.
As social networks evolve, they encourage users to share more information,
requiring the users, in turn, to place more trust into the social network.
Peer-to-peer (P2P) overlays provide an environment that can return ownership of
information, trust, and control to the users, away from centralized third-party
social networks.

In this paper, we present a novel concept, social profile overlays,
which enable users to share their profile only with trusted peers in a scalable,
reliable, and private manner.  Each user's profile consists
of a unique private, secure overlay, where members of that overlay have a
friendship with the overlay owner. Profile data is made available regardless of
the state of the profile owner through the use of the profile overlay's
distributed data store.  Privacy and security are enforced through the use of a
public key infrastructure (PKI), where the role of certificate authority (CA) is
handled by the overlay owner and each member of the overlay has a CA-signed
certificate.  To discover friends and bootstrap connections into the profile
overlay, each member of the social network joins a common public or directory
overlay.  We define interfaces and present tools that can be used to implement
this system, as well as explore some of the challenges related to it.

\section{Introduction}
Online social networking has become pervasive in daily life, though as social
networks grow so does the wealth of personal information that they store.  Once
information has been released on a social network, known as a user's profile,
the data and the user are at the mercy of the terms dictated by the social network 
infrastructure, which today is typically third-party, centrally owned.  If the social
network engages in activites disagreeable to the user, due to change of terms or
opt-out programs not well understood by users such as recent issues
with Facebook's Beacon program~\cite{facebook_beacon}, the options presented to the user are limited:
to leave the social network (surrendering their identity and features provided
by the social network), to accept the disagreeable activities, or to petition
and hope that the social network changes its behavior. 

As the use of social networking expands to become the primary way in which users
communicate and express their identity amongst their peers, the users become
more dependent on the policies of social network infrastructure owners.  Recent
work~\cite{p2p_socialnetwork} explores the coupling between social networks and
P2P systems as a means to return ownership to the users, noting that a social
network made up of social links is inherently a P2P system with the aside that
they are currently developed on top of centralized systems.  In this paper, we
extend this idea with focus on the topic of topology; that is, how to self-organize
social profiles that leverage the benefits offered by a structured P2P overlay abstraction.

Structured P2P overlays provide a scalable, resilient, and self-managing
platform for distributed applications.  Structured overlays enable users to
easily create their own decentralized systems for the purpose of data sharing,
interactive activities, and other networking-enabled activities.  In recent
work~\cite{icdcs10}, we have implemented mechanisms that allow users to create
and manage their own private overlays using a common public overlay to assist
in discovery and NAT traversal. This prior work focuses on generic structured
P2P private overlays; in this paper, we
expand upon this approach with in-depth discussion on how to apply this technique to
enable social network overlay profiles.

Social networks consist of users, each of whom has a profile, a set
of friends, and private messaging.  The profile contains the user's
personal information, status updates, and public conversations.  Friends are
individuals which the user trust sufficiently to view their profile.  Private
messaging allows users to send messages between each other without leaking any
information to other friends.  Using this model, we describe how a common
directory overlay can be used to provide services for finding friends and
joining existing profile overlays.  Each user has their own profile overlay,
secured via public key infrastructure (PKI) to which they are the certificate
authority (CA).  The profile data is stored in the profile overlay's distributed
datastore, allowing profile information to be accessed in scalable mechanisms
regardless of the profile owner's online state.  In this paper, we present
the architecture of these overlays as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:system} and
how they are used to find and befriend peers, and describe approaches to
handling profile data, and establishing initial connections to profile overlays.

but a single root; this relationship is represented by dashed lines in various
shades of grey.  For clarity, overlay shortcut connections are not shown.}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  Section~\ref{background}
provides background and related work.  Section~\ref{social_overlays} describes
our multi-overlay approach, explaining how to map social networks onto structured
P2P overlays.  In Section~\ref{outstanding}, we explore some of the remaining
challenges confronted by our system.  We conclude the paper in
Section~\ref{conclusion}.

\section{Background}
\label{background}
In this section, we review structured P2P overlays and distributed,
decentralized online social network approaches.
\subsection{Structured P2P Overlays}
Structured P2P systems provide distributed lookup services with guaranteed
search time with a lower bound of $O(\log N)$, in contrast to unstructured
systems, which rely on global knowledge/broadcasts, or stochastic techniques
such as random walks~\cite{unstructured_v_structured}.  Some examples of
structured systems can be found in~\cite{pastry, chord, symphony, kademlia,
can, dynamo}.  In general, structured systems are able to make these guarantees by
self-organizing a structured topology, such as a 2D ring or a hypercube.

In the overlay, each node is given a unique node ID drawn from a large address
space.  Each node ID must be unique otherwise address collisions will occur,
which can prevent nodes from participating in the overlay.  Furthermore, having
the node IDs well distributed assists in providing better scalability as many
shortcut selection algorithms depend on having node IDs uniformly distributed
across the entire address space.  Two approaches to ensure this behavior are
to have each node use a cryptographically strong random number generator to
generate the node ID, or to use a trusted third party generate node IDs and
cryptographically sign them~\cite{secure_routing}.

% I'd say the following paragraphs are probably unnecessary for IPTPS folks
% can save space by removing them
% As with all P2P systems, in order for an incoming node to connect with
% the overlay, the node must know of at least one active participant.  A list of
% nodes that are running on public addresses is typically distributed with the
% application, available through some out-of-band mechanism, or possibly using
% multicast to findpools~\cite{pastry}.
%
% In dealing with ring based overlays, a node must be connected to closest
% neighbors in the node ID address space; optimizations for fault tolerance
% suggest that it should be between 2 to $\log(N)$ on both sides.  Having
% multiple peers on both sides assists in stabilizing the overlay structure
% when experiencing churn, particularly when peers leave without warning.

Overlay shortcuts enable efficient routing in ring-structured P2P systems.
Different shortcut selection methods include: maintaining large tables without
using connections and only verifying usability when routing
messages~\cite{pastry, kademlia}, maintaining a connection with a peer every
set distance in the P2P address space~\cite{chord}, or using locations drawn
from a harmonic distribution in the node address space~\cite{symphony}.

Most structured P2P overlays support decentralized storage/lookup of information by
mapping keys to specific node IDs in an overlay.  At a minimum, the data is stored
at the node ID either smaller or larger to the data's node ID and for fault
tolerance the data can be stored at other nodes.  This sort of mapping
and data storage is called a distributed hash table (DHT).  DHTs provide the
building blocks to form more complex distributed data stores as presented in
Past~\cite{past} and Kosha~\cite{kosha}.

In \cite{one_ring, can_multicast}, the authors discuss the concept a
single overlay supporting services through the use of additional overlays
that use the underlying overlay to assist in discovery.  In \cite{icdcs10}, we
describe a reference implementation of a multiple overlay system that supports
the use of a public overlay's DHT to store currently active peers in the private
overlays. The system allows users to create their own private overlays without
having to create their own bootstrap network.  During evaluation, using both
simulated and real systems, we saw that the time for one node to join a public
and thereafter private overlay was small and grew logarithmically with network
sizes.  The real system was tested using a public overlay of 600 nodes and any
where from 1 to 600 peers in the private overlay using security, the time to
connect was always less than 22 seconds.    In simulations, we tested public
and private overlays varying from 1,000 to 100,000 peers.  For 1,000 public
overlay peers, regardless of the private overlay size though with security enabled,
connected within 22 seconds.  The 100,000 peer system, regardless of the private
overlay size though with security enabled, connected in less than 48 seconds.  

In addition, our system provides both relay-based and hole-punching NAT
traversal~\cite{nsdi10} techniques and supports point-to-point
PKI based security~\cite{icdcs10}, forming a basis for the approach
presented in this paper.

\subsection{Peer-to-Peer Social Networks}
The recent popularity and growing privacy issues of centralized online social
networks has motivated research projects aimed at providing private, P2P social
networks~\cite{peerson, matryoshka, tribler-osn, vis-a-vis}.

In~\cite{peerson}, a DHT provides the lookup service for storing metadata
pertaining to a peer's profile. Peers query the DHT for updated content from 
their friends by hashing their unique identifiers (e.g. friends' email
addresses).  The retreived metadata contains information for obtaining the
profile data such as IP address and file version. Their work relies
on a PKI system that provides identification, encryption, and access control.
In contrast, our approach provides each user their own private overlay secured
by point-to-point encryption and authentication amongst all peers in the profile
overlay.  The profile overlay provides a clean abstraction of access control,
whereby once admitted to a private overlay, users can access a distributed data
store which holds the contents of the owners profile.

\cite{vis-a-vis} takes a different approach by depending on virtual individual
servers (VIS) hosted on a cloud infrastructure such as Amazon EC2. Friends
contact each other's VIS directly for updates and uses a DHT as a directory for
groups or interest-based searches. Their approach assumes bidirectional
end-to-end connectivity between each VIS, where a profile is only available
during the uptime of the VIS.  Because of the demands on network connectivity
and uptime, the approach assumes a cloud-hosted VIS and has difficulty being used on user-owned resources.
Our approach enables users to avoid the need for all-to-all connectivity and
constant uptime through the use of NAT traversal support and the
ability to store the profile in the overlay's distributed data store.

The matryoshka approach presented in~\cite{matryoshka} also uses a DHT for
looking up a peer's matryoshka or circle of friends. Once a node in the peer's
outermost circle is found, that node is used to route profile requests to the
innermost circle which contains replicas of a peer's profile. Trust is enabled
through the use of an identification service contacted through the DHT.  The
circle of friends concept lacks the simplicity of the abstraction made in our
approach, whereby a variety of existing structured overlay techniques can be used as a profile
overlay without concern over innermost and outermost circles.  Our approach
also enables the profile owner to serve as a CA, ensuring that nodes can only
access a profile overlay after having obtained a signed certificate.

Unlike the above approaches, the P2P social network presented in~\cite{tribler-osn}
uses an unstructured overlay and does not require a DHT.  Peers
connect to each other directly over IP without any overlay routing. Once peers
are friends, they maintain unique identifiers to deal with dynamic IPs.  Peers
cache each other's data for availability through replication, and helper nodes
are used to assist with communication between peers behind NATs.  However, the
approach lacks security and access control considerations and lacks the
guarantees and the simplicity of the abstraction offered by a structured overlay.

\section{Social Overlays}
\label{social_overlays}
In this section, we explain how to map online social networking to our
multi-overlay social network consisting of a public directory overlay with many
private profile overlays.  The directory overlay supports friend discovery and
verification and stores a lists of peers currently active in each profile
overlay.  Profile overlays support message boards, private messages, and media
sharing.

\subsection{Finding and Verifying Friends}
In a traditional social network, a directory provides users the ability to search
for other users using public information, such as the user's full name, user ID,
e-mail address, group affiliations, and friends.  The search results return zero
or more matching directory entries.  Based upon the results, the user can
potentially make a friendship request.  The request receiver can review the
public information of the requestor prior to making a decision.  If the receiver
accepts the request, the peers are given access to each other's profiles.
Once profile access has been enabled, the users can learn more information, and
if it turns out to be a mistake, the peers can unilaterally end the relationship.

To map this to our proposed social overlay, the directory entries would be
inserted into the DHT of a public overlay.  As discussed in previous work, the
keys where the directory entries are stored at consist of a subset of the user's
public information in lower-case format and hashed to an overlay  address.  The
value stored at these keys is the user's certificate, which consists of its public
information and an overlay address where the user expects to receive
notifications.  The overlay address can be used for asynchronous offline
messaging, whose function we will explain shortly.

Because the users need a way to verify each other that involves social credentials,
we propose the use of a new form of certificate.
The main portion of the certificate is similar to a self-signed
x509~\cite{x509} certificate with public information such as user's name, e-mail
address, and group affiliations embeded into the certificate.  At the tail of
the certificate is a friend list represented by many friend entries.  To do this
we propose employing a technique similar to PGP~\cite{pgp}: users can acquire from their
friends a signed message consisting of a hash of the peer's certificate, the
time stamp, and the friend's certificate hash signed by the friend.  Since PGP
does not provide a strong method for revocation, the time stamp provides
additional information to help decide whether or not a friendship link is still
active without accessing the profile overlay of either peers.  Peers should
request a new friend list entry within a certain period of time or it will
appear that the friendship is no longer valid.

While looking for an individual, a peer may discover that many individuals have
overlapping public information components, such as the user's name.  Assuming
all entries are legitimate, the overlay must support inserting multiple values
at the same key, leaving the peer or the peer's DHT client to parse the
responses and determining the best match by reviewing the contents of each
certificate.  Alternatively, a technique like Sword~\cite{sword}, which supports
distributing the data across a set of nodes and using a bounded broadcast to
discover peers that match all information, could be used for searching.

Upon discovering an individual with whom a peer would like to establish a
friendship, the peer will issue a friendship request.  As stated earlier, the
data stored in the directory has an overlay address, where a peer expects
friendship requests to be inserted into the DHT.  The friendship request
consists of the self-signed certificate of the requesting peer, the public
information of the request receiver, and a time stamp, all signed with the
private key associate with the requesting peers private key matched to their
self-signed certificate.
% Though because DHTs are soft state systems having
% leases, the requester must reinsert the request upon timeout and no response for
% the receiver.

Within a reasonable amount of time after a request has been inserted into the
DHT, the receiver can come online and check for outstanding requests.  If the
receiver would like to add the user, they may do so conditionally or
unconditially.  During an unconditional accept, the peer signs the request of the
originating requester and issues a request to befriend the origatoing requester.
Alternatively in the case of a conditional accept, the user issues a friendship
request, waits for a reply, and investigates the profile prior to signing the
originating requester's request.  Once a user has received a signed certificate,
they may access the remote peer's profile overlay as discussed
in~\ref{profile_overlay}, which is also responsible for activities such as
revocation.

%Since a DHT is a soft-state system that uses leases to remove expired data, requests
%and responses must be occassionally reinserted into the DHT.  Alternatively, the
%approaches mentioned in~\cite{} that suggest methods of storing data in overlays
%using quotas could be used to ensure fair usage of the overlay.

\subsection{The Profile Overlay}
\label{profile_overlay}
In a traditional social network, the profile or user-centric portion consists
of a public message board for status updates or public messages, private
messaging, data sharing, and maintenance of existing friendships.  In this
section, we explain how these components can be applied to a structured overlay
dedicated to an individual profile.

The profile overlay consists of all the online friends of the profiler owner.
Using the techniques such as those described in~\cite{icdcs10}, it is feasible
to efficiently multiplex a P2P across multiple, virtual private overlays.
For access control, we employ a PKI, where each member uses the signed certificate
generated during the ``finding and verifying friends'' stage.  All links are
encrypted using symmetric security algorithms established through the PKI,
thus preventing uninvited guests from gaining direct access to the overlay and
hence the profile.  Because the profile owner also is the CA for all members of
the overlay, they can easily revoke users from access to the profile overlay.
In ~\cite{icdcs10}, we described mechanisms for overlay revocation through the
use of broadcasting for immediate revocation and the use of DHT for indirect
and permanent revocation.

The message board of a profile can be stored in two ways: distributed within the
profile overlay via a data store or stored on the profile owner's personal
computing devices.  The distributed data store provide the profile when the
owner is offline and also distributes the load for popular profiles.  For
higher availability, each peer should always be a provider for all data in their
profile when they are online.  To ensure authenticity and integrity, all peers
should sign their messages and each peers certificate should be available in
the overlay for verification.  Messages that are unsigned should be ignored
by all members of the overlay.  An ideal overlay for this purpose should
support complex queries~\cite{complex_queries} allowing easy access to data
stored chronologically, by content, bo byte type, i.e., media, status updates,
or message board discussions.

Private messaging in the profile overlay is unidirectional meaning that only
the profile owner can receive private messages using their overlay.  To
enforce this, a private message should be prepended with a symmetric key
encrypted by the profile owners public key, the message should be appended
by a hash of the message to ensure integrity and the entire message encrypted
by the symmetric key.  This approach ensures that only the sender and the
profile owner can decrypt the private message.  The contents of the private
message should include the sender, time sent, and the subject.  Messages can
be stored in well known locations, so that the profile owner can either poll
the location or, alternatively, use an event based system to notify them of
the new message.

\subsection{Active Peers}
The directory overlay should be used to assist in finding currently active peers
in the profile overlays.  By placing their node IDs at a well-known, unique
per-profile overlay key in the DHT, active peers can bootstrap incoming peers
into the profile overlay.  We implemented and evaluated this concept
in~\cite{icdcs10}.  Because the profile overlay members all use PKI to ensure
membership, even if malicious peers insert their ID into the active list, it would be useless as the peer
would only form connections with peers who also have a signed certificate for
that profile.

\section{Challenges}
\label{outstanding}
The following list consists of the issues that need further addressing, though
list is not exhaustive:

{\bf 1) Handling small overlay networks} - Most research into overlay focuses on
networks larger than the typical user's friend count, the average on Facebook
is 125.  This comes up with regards to the reliability of the overlay as the
system may potentially be under constant churn.  This is why it is critical
that a user host their own profile, but what happens if the user is disconnected
churn is so significant that a profile cannot be maintained in the overlay?
Perhaps a group of users could come together using a common, centralized resource
to provide dedicated hosting for their social profiles.  This keeps the spirit
of user owned systems and contributes to the reliability of the social overlay.

{\bf 2) Overlay support for low bandwidth, unconnected devices} - devices such as
smart phones cannot constantly be actively connected to the overlay and the
connection time necessary to retrieve something like a phone number may be
too much to make this approach unuseful.  Similar to the previous challenge,
this approach could benefit from having shared common, centralized resource
enabling users access to their social overlays by proxy without establishing a
direct connection to the overlay network.

{\bf 3) Reliability of the directory and profile overlay} - All overlays are
susceptible to attacks that can nullify the usefulness of the overlay.  While
the profile overlay does have point-to-point security it can be very difficult
to reclaim an overlay if there are enough malicious users.  In a public overlay
without some form of centralization, policing the system becomes a very
complicated procedure.  Previous work has proposed methods to ensure the usability
of overlays even while under attack.  For the social overlay to be successful,
we must identify which methods should be used.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed methods by which a social network can be
decentralized through the use of structure P2P overlays.  Our system involves
the use of multiple overlays where all users join a common public overlay and
individual profile overlays.  The public overlay provides directory services
that enable users to find and befriend other peers and bootstrap connections
into the secure profile overlays.  Upon forming a friendship through the
directory overlay, peers are given CA signed certificates that allow them to
join each other's profile overlay.  The owner of the profile overlay acts as
CA allowing the user to unilaterally revoke certificate, thus ending
friendships with members of their overlay using efficient and reliable methods.
For the purpose of storing profile information into the overlay, we cite
previous work that can be used to provide distributed data services and give
examples of how to store data securely in the overlay.  Our proposed system
returns control of the social network and more importantly users' identity to
the users and eliminates the need for centralized social networks.
