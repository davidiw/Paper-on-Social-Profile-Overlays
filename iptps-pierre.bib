    abstract = {Social networking web sites, which allow users to create identities and link them to friends who have also created identities, are highly popular. Systems such as Facebook and MySpace utilize a traditional client-server approach to achieve this, which means that all identities and their social links (the entire social network) are stored and administered on central servers. Although this approach supports highly mobile user access - users can log-in from any computer - it also poses high dependence on predefined central server(s), which results in possible exploitation of private data.In this paper we present an alternative approach, based on gossip protocol, in which we use a completely decentralized peer-to-peer system to create and store the social network. Our system is self-administered and works in a highly transient environment of peer availability. We propose the design and implementation in Tribler of a distributed social networking system that is scalable and robust, allowing users to perform core social networking functions of establishing and removing social links without any requirement for centralized servers or administration.},

    abstract = {The recent surge in popularity of on-line social network applications raises serious concerns about the security and privacy of their users. Beyond usual vulnerabilities that threaten any distributed application over Internet, on-line social networks raise specific privacy concerns due their inherent handling of personal data. In this paper we point to the centralized architecture of existing on-line social networks as the key privacy issue and suggest a solution that aims at avoiding any centralized control. Our solution is an on-line social network based on a peer-to-peer architecture. Thanks to its fully distributed nature, the peer-to-peer architecture inherently avoids centralized control by any potentially malicious service provider. In order to cope with the lack of trust and lack of cooperation that are akin to peer-to-peer systems and to assure basic privacy among the users of the social network, our solution leverages the trust relationships that are part of the social network application itself. Privacy in basic data access and exchange operations within the social network is achieved thanks to a simple anonymization technique based on multi-hop routing among nodes that trust each other in the social network. Similarly cooperation among peer nodes is enforced based on hop-by-hop trust relationships derived from the social network.},

@inproceedings{peerson,
    abstract = {To address privacy concerns over Online Social Networks (OSNs), we propose a distributed, peer-to-peer approach coupled with encryption. Moreover, extending this distributed approach by direct data exchange between user devices removes the strict Internet-connectivity requirements of web-based OSNs. In order to verify the feasibility of this approach, we designed a two-tiered architecture and protocols that recreate the core features of OSNs in a decentralized way. This paper focuses on the description of the prototype built for the P2P infrastructure for social networks, as a first step without the encryption part, and shares early experiences from the prototype and insights gained since first outlining the challenges and possibilities of decentralized alternatives to OSNs.},

@techreport{vis-a-vis,
    abstract = {Online social networks (OSNs) are immensely pop-
ular, but their centralized control of sensitive user data
raises important privacy concerns. This paper presents
Vis-` a-Vis, a decentralized framework for online social
networking based on the privacy-preserving notion of a
Virtual Individual Server (VIS), a personal virtual ma-
chine running within a cloud-computing utility. In Vis-
` a-Vis, each person manages personal data such as friend
lists, photographs, and messages through his own VIS.
In addition, VISs self-organize into overlay networks
corresponding to social groups with whom their own-
ers wish to share information. Vis-` a-Vis uses distributed
hash tables to provide efficient and scalable operations
for joining, leaving, and searching a wide variety of
OSN groups. We haveevaluatedour Vis-` a-Vis prototype
in several virtual-computingenvironments using experi-
mental parameters observed in the Facebook OSN. Our
results demonstrate that Vis-` a-Vis represents an attrac-
tive alternative to today's centralized OSNs.},
